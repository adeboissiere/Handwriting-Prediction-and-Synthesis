Fruit. For fruit also this is the ideal
planting season and work can continue
at any time when the soil is in reasonable
condition until the end of March. For a
North wall I recommend a Morello cherry,
for an East wall a plum or greengage
and for a South or west-facing wall,
a peach, nectarine or apricot.
