What seems certain is that those who advocate putting off any approach until Mr 
Krushchev gives evidence of a change of heart (whatever that may mean) would

we should put to the Soviet Government as a basis for talks: and that means working 
out what we know to be the essential interests of the West in Berlin and what we 
suppose that the Soviet Government may now be after.
