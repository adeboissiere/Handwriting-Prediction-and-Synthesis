To be able to say "New York next week" is an important advance. We must not be 
overconfident that this meeting will lead on to further and decisive ones; but without 
it, we could not look for them. Federal Germany votes tomorrow and not a day too 
soon. There can seldom have been an election campaign which more people in and 
out of the country wanted to see over and done with.
