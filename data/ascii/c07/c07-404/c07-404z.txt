Aplomb is a cooling quality. His more
recent shield-like emblems or icons
yield their dark spell without the
demonstrativeness of Paolozzi's
encrusted objects. They are delibarately
frontal in aspect. Their intricately textured
and symbolic relief sometimes appears
positive on the front, negative on the back
surface.
