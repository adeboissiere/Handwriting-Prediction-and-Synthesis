From the day it hatches in the spring until it dies in the late autumn, the praying 
mantis satisfies its voracity by eating other insects. Nine blowflies may be consumed 
at one sitting and the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect, is able to keep a firm hold on one 
grasshopper while eating another. According to Dr. Max Beier in "Fangheuschrecken" 
(Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei, 1952), the praying mantis is trecking northwards.
