"Anne, They have stolen our
baby." It was not only their baby
- it was America's. Toulouse-Lautrec
At the Tate. Vigour and decay. By
David Sylvester. What is singular about
his use of them is that no other artist,
of his time or any other, has painted
them so directly, intime intimately
and pertinently.
