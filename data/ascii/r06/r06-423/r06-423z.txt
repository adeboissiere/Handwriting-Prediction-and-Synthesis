Here we stopped, as in fine
weather we always stopped.
Then here was Nice, and the
old holiday sea, blue as a new
school exercise book. The same
old Nice, creamy, vulgar, out
of time, bitter-sweet with the
ghosts of dead monarchs and
brilliant prostitutes, edging past
grubby grandeur to the old
sleeping port.
