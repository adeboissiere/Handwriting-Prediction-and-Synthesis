A radiant heater, dissipating 750 w
at 110 v, was mounted above the
workholder to raise the temperature
of the substrate to 300 deg C before
evaporation. The temperature of the
substrate was measured by means
of a chromel-alumel thermocouple
placed inside the vacuum chamber
with its junction resting on
the top face of the
workholder.
