Two samples of precipitated lead
chromate (lead-210, bismuth-210)
were counted and dissolved in nitric
acid in silica basins. The bismuth was
recovered from the eluate as the phosphate.
Results did not differ from those obtained
by the more convenient method of heating
the disslved chromates in 2 N hydrochloric
acid for fifteen minutes.
