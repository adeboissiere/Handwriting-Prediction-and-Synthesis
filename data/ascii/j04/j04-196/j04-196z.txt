In the preliminary experiments,
the tracer was added to a liter
of effluent and immediately
coprecipitated with strontium
sulphate from hot solution. Complete
exchange was obtained by
acidifying the effluent with five
milliliters of concentrated nitric
acid and boiling for more than
half an hour before
completing the coprecipitation.
