There is as yet no
morphological evidence
for a pressure-sensitive
organ in any of these forms,
and the mechanism of
perception is quite uncertain.
The unequivocal demonstration
of a sensitivity to pressure
in some of the deep-migrating
copepods or decapods would
be a valuable contribution
to the whole problem
of vertical migration.
