The increasing N.A.D.P.A.S.
prison welfare Officer complement
is providing an accumulating load
of home enquiries of many kinds
relating to health, marital and pro-
perty problems. Few of these homes
are on the telephone, many of the
wives or parents are working and
a long journey by public transport
is wasted if our caller can ob-
tain no reply.
