CSR:

Cowardly Government. The battles are
described in great detail and illustrade
with the usual plans - rectangles showing
troop-positions among vermiculated hills.
Readers who share my distrust of such tactical
exegesis must not skip the superb account
of Inkerman with its hand-to-hand tussles
in the fog.
