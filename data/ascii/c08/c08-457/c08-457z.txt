Creature of habit. We cannot refuse
him our pity. He worked himself to death at a
Herculean task for which he was fitted by
neither character nor experience. We
must remember at the same time
that he had been for the previous
twentyeight years Secretary at the
horse g ards apparently without
attempting any reform in the
administration of the army.
