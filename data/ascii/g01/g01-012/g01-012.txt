When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised the Earl of Arundel, who at that 
moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed, and with it Gaunt's hopes of 
fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return to England a disappointed and now 
even despised failure. The 'ribald' Londoners, who cursed Gaunt as the murderer of 
Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment at the non-arrival of booty, and 
comparing the failure of a subsidized duke with the independent success of a London 
citizen.
