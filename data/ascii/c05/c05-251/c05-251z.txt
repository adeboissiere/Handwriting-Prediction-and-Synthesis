Fine exhibition of sporting prints.
Age of the coloured aquatint. The
sporting prints by Herring and Alken
are good examples of an always popular
genre. Pictorial confections. The
idyllic combination of figure and
landscape in which these artists
have specialized needs a sweet
tooth of appreciation.
