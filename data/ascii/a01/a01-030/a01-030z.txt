African Delegates to the talks
yesterday called on Mr. Macmillan to
cease his negotiations with Sir Roy's
representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He
was at Chequers last week-end. They
said they regarded with "growing
anger" the "gross and unconstitutional"
interference by Sir Roy's Federal
Government in the talks.
