OCR:

Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of ventricular contraction. During cutting 
or puncture of the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion of blood from the wound. 
Arterial diastole is thus synchronous with cardiac systole but, when movement of 
blood through arteries is hindered by compression, infarction or interception, the 
more distal arteries pulsate less because their pulse is nothing other than the impulse 
of the blood entering them.
