How was it that Israel was brought
out from under the burdens of Egypt?
(Gen Rashi 19, 3 .) There were plenty
of cross-currents in those waters.
and clergy who would solemnly
have proclaimed their loyalty to
that prayer Book found as many
ways of interpreting that loyalty
as they do to-day.
